### About This Repository

This repository is a dedicated resource for students looking to excel in the ACSL. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of practice problems that mirror the style and difficulty of actual competition questions. By focusing on specific problem types, students can systematically strengthen their understanding and application of key computer science concepts.

### Features

* **Problem Generation:** We generate practice problems based on common ACSL categories, ensuring students get relevant and targeted practice.

* **Categorized by Topic:** Problems are sorted by their respective ACSL topics, such as Number Systems, Boolean Algebra, and Computer Organization, making it easy for students to focus on areas they need to improve.

* **Solutions and Explanations:** Each problem includes a solution and a detailed explanation of the logic, helping students not only find the right answer but also understand the reasoning behind it.

* **Goal-Oriented:** This resource is specifically created with the goal of helping students achieve high scores and earn awards in ACSL competitions.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone [https://github.com/msucse2004/american_computer_science_league.git]`
